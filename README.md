# Bulk File Renamer
A program to rename batches of files using a common template. This should be useful for developers or designers who regularly get sent a number of image files from clients that are all inconsistently named. With this program you can replace all spaces in words of all files at once, change case of all letters, or just rename all files with an incrementing number appended.
